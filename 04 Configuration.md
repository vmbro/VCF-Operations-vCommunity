## Configuration and Integration
Once the vCommunity Management Pack has been installed, you will create an Adapter Instance for your vCenter/s.

dd your vCenter FQDN and select a Cloud Proxy for the data collection. Other features are optional. If cloud proxy has container registry access then adapter should start data collection shortly.
