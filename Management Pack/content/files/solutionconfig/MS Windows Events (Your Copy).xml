     This is the actual file that will be used to collect the properties in your environment.
     Manually copy the entries (lines) from the Reference Copy that you want to monitor.
     The reason we have 2 separate files is any changes on the Reference Copy will not impact your environment during upgrade process.

     As an example, we've selected 1 entry.
     
     After you make changes, you do not have to restart the adapter. It will automatically read the updated config file name in the next collection cycle.
