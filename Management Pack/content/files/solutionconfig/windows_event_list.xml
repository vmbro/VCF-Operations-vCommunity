  DO NOT EDIT THIS CONFIG FILE, CLONE IT
  It shouldn't used by the adapter. The reason is any changes on this default config file will be overwritten during next upgrade process.
  
  It is a reference file as it has the example list of Windows Event IDs. 

  LIMITATIONS:
  Once collected, a property stays with the object forever. You cannot delete it, unless the object itself is deleted.
