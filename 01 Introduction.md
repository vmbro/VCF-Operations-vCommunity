# VCF Operations vCommunity

This Management Pack gives the user the ability to add your own content to VCF Operations. While the Management Pack Builder is an option for targets with REST APIs, the vCommunity Management Pack was built using the Integration SDK and offers more advanced features. 

With Phyton programming and VCF Operations API knowledge, you can:

* Add your own Metrics and Properties for existing VCF Objects. 
* Create your own Object Types.
* Add your own Alerts, Dashboards, and Reports. To override existing ones, simply use the same ID.
* Add your own Super Metrics. Note you need to enable them manually in the Policy UI.
