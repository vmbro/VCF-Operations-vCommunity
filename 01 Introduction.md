# VCF Operations vCommunity

This management pack lowers the knowledge barrier required to add your own content to VCF Operations. While the MP Builder is better for quick and simple addition, a native management pack empowers you to build more advanced features. 

With Phyton programming and VCF Operations API knowledge, you can:

* Add your own metrics and properties for the VCF Objects. They can have complex logic as it's all done in programming. Define them into the existing objects.
* Create your own object. You can define a new object type.
* Add your own alerts, dashboards, reports. To override existing ones, simply use the same ID
* Add your own super metric. Take note you need to enable them manually in the Policy UI.
